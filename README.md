### FinOps Analytics Dashboard

Interactive dashboard built using AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR), Amazon Athena, and Looker Studio to visualize cloud spend, optimization opportunities, and resource utilization.

### CI/CD Pipeline

Automated deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions. Every code change pushed to the main branch automatically deploys the website to Amazon S3 and invalidates the CloudFront cache.

### CloudFront Distribution

Global content delivery and HTTPS-enabled website distribution using Amazon CloudFront and AWS Certificate Manager.

### Serverless Visitor Counter

AWS Lambda and DynamoDB power a serverless visitor counter that tracks and displays website visits in real time.

## Infrastructure Components

### Static Website

- Amazon S3 hosts portfolio assets
- CloudFront distributes content globally
- Route 53 manages DNS
- ACM provides HTTPS certificates

### Visitor Counter API

- JavaScript calls Lambda Function URL
- Lambda updates DynamoDB visitor count
- Count displayed dynamically on homepage

### Infrastructure as Code

Terraform provisions:

- S3 Bucket
- CloudFront Distribution
- Route 53 Records
- Lambda Function
- DynamoDB Table
- IAM Resources

### CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions automatically:

- Deploys website updates to S3
- Invalidates CloudFront cache
- Publishes changes without manual intervention

---

## FinOps Dashboard

The project includes an AWS cost optimization dashboard built from Cost & Usage Reports.

### KPIs

- Total Monthly Spend
- Average Utilization
- Non-Compliant Resources
- Estimated Optimization Savings
- Highest Cost Service

### Visualizations

- Spend by AWS Service
- Spend by Environment
- Tagging Compliance
- High-Risk Optimization Opportunities
